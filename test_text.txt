"Time Enough at Last" was one of the first episodes written for The Twilight Zone.
 It introduced Burgess Meredith to the series; he went on to star in three more episodes,
  being introduced as "no stranger to The Twilight Zone" in promotional spots for season two's "The Obsolete Man".
   He also narrated for the 1983 film Twilight Zone: The Movie, which made reference to
   "Time Enough at Last" during its opening sequence, with the characters discussing the episode in detail.
Footage of the exterior steps of the library was filmed several months after production had been completed.
 These steps can also be seen on the exterior of an Eloi public building in MGM's 1960 version of
 The Time Machine. John Brahm was nominated for a Directors Guild award for his work on the episode.
 The book that Bemis was reading in the vault and that flips open when the bomb explodes is
 A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus by Washington Irving.
